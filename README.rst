See the full documentation `here <https://pdghawk.github.io/deepQ-pong>`_.

This project uses tensorflow to reproduce, with a few variations, a subset of the
results of the DeepMind paper:

Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning." Nature 518.7540 (2015): 529. (`pdf here <https://daiwk.github.io/assets/dqn.pdf>`_.)

In particular, a double-deep Q network is used to solve pong specifically, although
the code base should be easily extendable to other Atari games within the open ai
gym environment.
