This project uses tensorflow to reproduce, with a few variations, a subset of the
results of the DeepMind paper:

Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning." Nature 518.7540 (2015): 529. (`pdf here <https://daiwk.github.io/assets/dqn.pdf>`_.)

In particular, a double-deep Q network is used to solve pong specifically, although
the code base should be easily extendable to other Atari games within the open ai
gym environment.

Further details of code can be found in the `documentation: <https://pdghawk.github.io/deepQ-pong>`_.
