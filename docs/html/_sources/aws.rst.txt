AWS Scripts
=============

Within the directory aws_scripts helper functions are provided for uploading code,
and downloading results from aws EC2 instances. For a brief description of how
to use tensorboard locally when running on an EC2 instance see: :ref:`AWS_TB`

The general format for running all of these helper functions is, for a generic
helper function 'aws_helper.sh':

~$ sh aws_helper.sh <key> <aws_ec2_address>

where

key             = key.pem with key.pem being the key used to ssh into the EC2 instance,(key location should be ~/.ssh/key.pem)

aws_ec2_address = the web address associated with the EC2 instance.

Upon starting an EC2 instance and ssh'ing in, one should perform via ssh

(ec2-instance)$ mkdir deep-pong
(ec2-instance)$ cd deep-pong
(ec2-instance)$ mkdir code


all downloads from aws helper scripts will be saved in:
deepQ-pong/aws_runs/DATE/TIME
where DATE and TIME, are the date and time of download

upload_code.sh
---------------

~$ sh upload_code.sh <key> <aws_ec2_address>

will upload the DQN package, simple_loops.py, and play_from_ckpt.py files

get_game_arrays.sh
-------------------

~$ sh get_game_arrays.sh <key> <aws_ec2_address>

will download all saved game arrays from the ec2 instance to deepQ-pong/aws_runs/DATE/TIME

get_summaries.sh
-------------------

~$ sh get_game_arrays.sh <key> <aws_ec2_address>

will download all tensorboard summary data from the ec2 instance to deepQ-pong/aws_runs/DATE/TIME

get_ckpts.sh
-------------------

~$ sh get_ckpts.sh <key> <aws_ec2_address>

will download all saved checkpoint data from the ec2 instance to deepQ-pong/aws_runs/DATE/TIME
